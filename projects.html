	            <h2>YOUR Roguelike Adventure</h2>
	            <p>
	                A short roguelike shooter with dynamic difficulty. The game is
	                being developed by a team of 5, led by a graduate student from
	                Laguna College of Art and Design. As a programmer, I've worked
	                on the random level generation and map selection.

	           <h2>Salvation</h2>
	           <p>
	               A 2D Metroidvania I developed over the summer for XPrize 
	               Connect's Code Games. This was my first time using Unity and
	               I got overambitious with the project. Though it didn't make it
	               to the final round, this project was a great learning 
	               experience.

	           <p>
	               A mod for Terraria I've been working on for brief periods of
	               time over the last 2 years. Though it is currently lacking, I 
	               plan on adding more content in the future.
