	                A short roguelike shooter with dynamic difficulty. I worked
					with 2 other programmers to develop the game's functionalities. 
	                I've worked on the random level generation, map selection, 
					enemy AI, and various other core mechanics. Working with other 
					programmers allowed me to I learned many new tools and tricks in 
					Unity. The experience of working under a lead designer was also
					interesting, though sometimes frustrating.

	               A 2D Metroidvania I developed over the summer for XPrize 
	               Connect's Code Games. This was my first time using Unity and
	               I got overambitious with the project. I was limit testing myself;
				   every subsequent boss introducing at least one new mechanic 
		          (attack indicators, player tracking, bullet hell, summons, etc.).
				   Though it didn't make it to the final round, 
				   this project was a great learning experience.

	               A mod for Terraria I've been working on for brief periods of
	               time over the last 2 years (2019-2020). Though it is currently sparse, I 
	               plan on adding more content in the future.

	               My attempt to recreate the game Snake using Javascript. While there are
	               some game-breaking bugs, it was fun figuring out how to get the snake
	               to move and grow. I spent about a week on this project during my junior
	               year of highschool.

	               An idle game I made over the winter of my sophomore year in highschool,
	               focusing on learning the UI aspect of game design.

	               This was my first project outside of class. In the beginning, I had a
	               lot of things I wanted to implement but it quicky became too large to
	               handle. I came back after about two years to finish whatever features
	               I had already added.

                    A website built during my days in highschool, containing my
                    older works. I keep it around for nostalgia.
