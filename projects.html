	                A short roguelike shooter with dynamic difficulty. The game is
	                being developed by a team of 5, led by a graduate student from
	                Laguna College of Art and Design. As a programmer, I've worked
	                on the random level generation and map selection.

	               A 2D Metroidvania I developed over the summer for XPrize 
	               Connect's Code Games. This was my first time using Unity and
	               I got overambitious with the project. Though it didn't make it
	               to the final round, this project was a great learning 
	               experience.

	               My attempt to recreate the game Snake using Javascript. While there are
	               some game-breaking bugs, it was fun figuring out how to get the snake
	               to move and grow. I spent about a week on this project during my junior
	               year of highschool.

	               This was my first project outside of class. In the beginning, I had a
	               lot of things I wanted to implement but it quicky became too large to
	               handle. I came back after about two years to finish whatever features
	               I had already added.
